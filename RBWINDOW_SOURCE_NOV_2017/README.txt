This tool was created as a way for my sister to itemize her purchases, milage, paychecks, and deductions for a 1098
tax form. While inefficient and ultimately unneeded this application was a great learning experience for coding in C#.

Using Windows forms as a GUI, this application queries the user for various pieces of tax information, then pushes it all
to a .csv file for the current year. New directories, and files can be created dynamically depending on existance and the
changing of the current year.
 
A compiled .exe version of this application is provded by Visual Studio in the /bin/debug folder, if you would just like
to see it in action.
